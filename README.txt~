pYBA: Bayesian Astrometry
=========================

pyBA is a Python implementation of the Bayesian Astrometry 
framework. It provides a module for handling probability
distribution that represent astronomical objects and for 
analysing the changes to these distributions between images.

Typical use might look like::

    #!/usr/bin/env python
    
    from pyBA import bivarg
    # ... more basic example code here

It aspires to (but does not yet) provide:

* MCMC likelihood computation (using either 
  emcee or pymc)

* A full gaussian process astrometic analysis
  (perhaps using scikits.learn)

* An interface with wcslib and pyfits

* A helpful set of examples

Representation of astronomical objects
======================================

Bayesian astrometry represents astronomical objects as
bivariate gaussians. The **bivarg** module provides the
routines for creating these objects. Upon initialisation,
these objects are assigned the following properties:

1. Fundamental descriptors of the distribution:

* *mu*: A two-vector representing the central location
  of the objects

* *sigma*: A 2x2 covariance matrix representing the
  uncertainity in the location of the object.

* *theta*: A complementary representation of the covariance
  between the x- and y-coordinates.

2. Derived quantities used for manipulating objects

* *E*,*V*: The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance
  matrix, used for linear transformations of the distribution.

* *det*, *chol*, *trace*: The determinant, Cholesky root and
  the trace of the covariance matrix.
